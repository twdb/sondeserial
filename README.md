# SondeSerial
### Serial manipulation of YSI datasondes
This package will manipulate a serial connection to YSI datasondes in order to change settings, log instantaneous data, read system configurations, and start unattended deployments. This is part of a larger project which aims to create a cheap and efficient alternative to real-time telemetric setups using commodity hardware (i.e. rasperry pi's).
